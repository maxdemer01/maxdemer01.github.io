My name is Ismael Contreras and I am from Ja√©n, Spain. I have always been fascinated by everything related to technology, and as I have grown up I have realized that this is what I want to dedicate my life to. Recently I discovered another of my great passions, mathematics.

That is why I will be publishing, with more or less regularity, articles about topics that interest me, projects that I am doing or tutorials explaining in a synthesized way something that has cost me a headache or two. The topics, as I have already mentioned, will orbit around my two favorite areas of knowledge, and even touch on topics related but not included in these areas.

Without much research, one realizes the importance of content creation in the Internet world. Therefore, and not to be left behind, I have decided to open this page where I will contribute to the world that bit of sand, and help people who, like me, at some point were lost in the vast field that we deal with.

In addition, I will use this section as a portfolio where I will gradually add my progress in the academic and business world.
