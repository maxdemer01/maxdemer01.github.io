Today I am going to talk about [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net), a website where we will find hundreds of mathematical problems of varying difficulty that we will have to solve by designing algorithms and programs in our favorite programming language. 

According to the official Project Euler (or PE) website, the problems we will encounter will require logic and knowledge of computers and programming to be solved, rather than mathematical knowledge. However, it will lead to more precise and elegant answers.

*"Project Euler exists to encourage, challenge, and develop the skills and enjoyment of anyone with an interest in the fascinating world of mathematics."*

With over a million users who have solved at least one problem, PE is aimed at anyone who wants to maintain and improve their problem solving skills.

Any reader of this blog should, at a variable rate, be able to solve all the problems, as each problem uncovers a concept needed to solve subsequent problems.

Before we start solving, we'll have to register with our email, but it's completely free.

Once inside, we will have access to the 827 problems in the Archives tab. I have solved only a few of them, but I am sure that anybody could do better than me with perseverance.

I recommend taking a look at the About page, as we will be able to find information about the history, the rules and some tips. In short, we will not be able to publish the solutions to the first 100 problems, since they are introductory and will lay the groundwork for the next (and more difficult) problems.
Also, as my recommendation, if you ever get stuck, move on to the next one, or take a break. Sometimes, the mind gets blocked and we just can't think, but with a little break we will see everything more clearly.  

In closing, I encourage readers to try and take a look at the problems, and if you like, share your opinions in your comments. See you in the future!
